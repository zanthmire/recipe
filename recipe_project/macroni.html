    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is easily multiplied for a crowd. Everyone in my family asks me to bring this to our functions. I
        even make it for weddings. Sometimes I use a mixture of different kinds of pasta, especially if I only have a
        little of this kind or that. Depending on what type of macaroni used, more dressing may be required. The recipe
        calls for red onion, but sweet onion is great, too.</p>
